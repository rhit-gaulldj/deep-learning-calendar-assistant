I have to do the following assignments this week: calculus homework, write a philosophy essay, do a lab report, and work on my computer science project. The calculus homework should take me about 1 hour, the essay should take me about 4 hours, the lab report should take me about 3 hours, and the computer science project should take me about 5 hours. Please schedule out when I should work on my homework. I do not need to complete each assignment in a single run (for example, I can do 2 hours of computer science project on Monday and then 3 hours on Tuesday).
